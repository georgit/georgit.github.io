      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my research site!
I&amp;rsquo;ve always put off making one because I figure everyone who wanted to find me could do so already, and I have no idea what to write about, but now that I&amp;rsquo;m publishing papers, I figure I might as well.
Not sure that there will be a lot of posts here, but I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; sure there will be no Facebook political opinions, since I think we&amp;rsquo;re all tired of those.
Please also note that as my work is in systems, this site is not going to be flashy or fancy.
This is by design.&lt;/p&gt;
